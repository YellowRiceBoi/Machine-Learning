# Nvidia Stock Predictor
This little Project is a little Test in how I can extract Data from a CSV file and use the data to train a model and predict some data. The model is quiet rough at this time, but I will optimize the model in the future. 

## stock_scraper.py
Now that I built a web scraper that scrapes the data from Yahoo Finance (it is legal, I checked). I am able to train my model to predict the future stock price using data from the web/internet.
